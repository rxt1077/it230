.Malware Analysis
[lab]
--

The website https://any.run[Any Run] offers free interactive malware analysis.
We will be using this site to avoid the complications of running malware in a VM.

Start by visiting https://any.run[Any Run] and registering for an account with your NJIT email address.
Once you have activated your account via email, follow the tutorial to learn how to analyze threats.
Use the demo-sample task provided by Any Run.
Follow the prompts and watch how the process tree changes.
Feel free to take your time, even after the time expires you will still be able to look at the running processes and analyze HTTP Requests, Connections, DNS Requests, and Threats.

For this lab we are going to look at an example of https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/backdoor-avemaria/[Backdoor.AveMaria], a family of Remote Access Trojans (RATs) which taget Windows systems.
On the left-hand side of the Any Run site, click on _Public Submissions_ and search for the `avemaria` tag.
Choose _one_ of the examples (there are hundreds) and look through the screenshots to get an idea of how the malware is run.
It may also help to glance at the network traffic processes.

Run the VM live by clicking _Restart_ in the upper right-hand corner.
Perform the actions necessary to trigger the malware, adding time as needed.
Finally open notepad on the VM, type in your name, and take a unique screenshot.
