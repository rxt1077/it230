= Malware (WIP)

== What is malware?

Malware is a portmanteau of the words _malicious_ and _software_.
The term is used to describe many different types of _intentionally malicious_ programs.
Malware damages or exploits computer systems.
It often spies on, spams, or otherwise damages target or host machines.

The most popular target for malware is the Windows OS by quite a large margin.
This is due largely to its popularity as a desktop operating system.
The second largest target is web browsers, which afford malware a unique cross-platform reach.
The third largest target is the Android mobile operating system, which while technically Linux runs mostly on mobile phones.
Both Linux and Mac do not receive as much malware attention.
While this may be partially due to the open-source nature of Linux and the BSD kernel used by Macs, it is also partially due to the lack of popularity of each of these operating systems.
Malware is often widely distributed, meaning it can target only the most popular/possibly weakest links and still be successful.

.Zero Days
****
Modern operating systems employ layers of security to ensure that programs do not have access to sensitive information or applications.
This typically means that for malware to be effective, it needs to elevate its privileges.
The most effective malware can perform privilege escalation without requiring user interaction.
To do this malware may rely on new/undocumented exploits or vulnerabilities.
These new exploits that have been disclosed for "zero days" are hence are referred to as _zero days_.
Zero days are incredibly powerful and may be hoarded by APTs/criminal groups or sold for millions of dollars on the Dark Web.

== Types of Malware

The definition of malware is so broad and new malware is being created daily.
This can make it difficult to classify malware.
As we go through some basic types, please keep in mind that there is significant overlap.
For example, you may encounter ransomware distributed as a virus _or_ ransomware distributed as a trojan.
The fact that it is ransomware does not preclude it from being some other type of malware as well. 

=== Worms, Viruses, and Trojans

Worms are self-propagating programs that spread without user interaction.
Their code is typically stored within an independent object, such as a hidden executable file.
Worms often do not severely damage their host, as they are concerned with rapid, exponential spreading.

.Stuxnet
====
Stuxnet was a 2010 worm that specifically targeted Iranian nuclear facilities.
The worm used an unprecedented four zero-day attacks and was designed to spread via USB flash drives and Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs).
In this way it didn't just rely on networks to propagate.
Ultimately Stuxnet's payload targeted the code used to program PLC devices that control motors and make them spin too fast, destroying the centrifuges.
Stuxnet also employed an impressive rootkit to cover its tracks.
Given the level of sophistication Stuxnet is believed to have been developed by the US and Israel.
====

Viruses typically require user interaction, such as copying and infected file from one machine to another, and store their code inside another file on a machine.
An executable file may be infected by having the virus code added a separate page that executes before the standard program code.
Viruses can be quite damaging to the host as they may take significant resources to spread locally.
The term virus is also an unfortunately overloaded one.
Due to it's popularity it is often used by some lower-skill threat actors to refer to many different types of malware.

.Concept Virus
====
The Concept virus was the first example of a Microsoft Word macro virus.
The virus hid itself inside Microsoft Word files and used Word's embedded macro language to perform its replication tasks.
Viruses were later created for Excel and other programs that had sufficiently sophisticated yet ultimately insecure internal scripting languages.
====

A trojan is a form of malware that disguises itself as legitimate software.
It does not have to rely on a software exploit as much as it exploits users into installing, running, or giving extra privileges to the malicious code.
Trojans are the most popular kind of malware as they can be used as an attack vector for many other payloads.
The name comes from Greek mythology, where a Trojan horse was disguised as a gift and given to a besieged town.
Within the large horse were secret troops who came out in the middle of the night and opened the town gates.

.Emotet
====
Emotet is a banking trojan from 2014 that spread through emails.
It made use of malicious links or macro-enabled documents to make the user download its code.
Emotet has been one of the most costly and destructive pieces of malware currently averaging about one million in incident remediation.
It continues to be adapted to avoid detection and make use of even more sophisticated malware.
====

=== Ransomware

image::wannacry.png[width=400, float=right]

Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts files and demands a ransom to decrypt them.
Modern ransomware uses symmetric encryption to the files quickly and then encrypts the symmetric key asymmetrically using a hard-coded public key for which the threat actor has the corresponding private key.
When the ransom is paid, typically via cryptocurrency, the threat actor can decrypt the symmetric key using their private key and the user can use the symmetric key to decrypt the files.

Ransomware is considered a data breach in the data is often exfiltrated as well.
It is also worth noting that when the ransom is paid, there is no guarantee that the threat actor will actually begin the decryption process.
Typical targets of ransomware include corporate infrastructure and health care systems although ransomware may also be spread indeterminately.
The payout of ransoms can be a large money-making enterprise so many APTs or criminal groups may employ its use.
Ransomware is considered the biggest threat to cyber stability today.

=== Spyware

Malware specifically designed for espionage/data theft is known as spyware.
Like ransomware, spyware can also have a monetary payoff for the threat actor.
Actors may use extortion to demand payment or the data will be _leaked_.
This typically means either sold on the dark web or publicly posted.
Once again, given the possibility of monetary gain, spyware is often associated with criminal groups.
APTs may use spyware as well to obtain secrets of national importance.

Customer data, trade secrets, proprietary data, and government secrets are all targets of spyware.
Even outside of governments systems, in the corporate setting, spyware is still a major threat. 

.Fileless Malware

....

Malware is often detected by scanning storage for files that match a particular hash or by looking in files to see if they contain patterns.
Both of these detection techniques rely on the malware being stored in a file.
Fileless malware attempts to avoid detection by leaving no footprint in the file system.
This type of malware uses legitimate processes to load itself into memory, often with a registry key created to reload every time the machine is restarted.
This creates a persistent, hard-to-detect type of malware that is often used by sophisticated threat actors such as APTs and criminal groups.

== Indicators of Compromise

An _indicator of compromise (IoC)_ is an artifact with high confidence the indicates an intrusion.
It is a way to tell if a machine has been a victim of malware.
IoCs are publicly communicated by security professionals in an effort to help mitigate the effects of malware.

.Common IoC Types
Hash::
    A hash of files that are known to be malicious.
    This can help in identifying trojans and worms.
IP addresses::
    Tracking the IP addresses which malware connects to can be used to determine if a machine is infected.
URLs/Domains::
    Tracking the URLs or domains that malware uses can also be used to determine if a machine is infected.
Virus definition/signature::
    Executables and other files can be scanned for specific sequences of bytes which are unique to a particular virus.
    In this way even if the malware is hiding within another file, it can still be detected.

== Delivery of Malware

Malware is often delivered through social engineering, namely convincing an actor within an organization to download and run or click on something.
It can also delivered through infiltrating the software packages something depends on, supply chain, or possibly through a software exploit on an publicly exposed service.
Some of the most common ways of spreading malware are detailed below.

=== Phishing

Phishing involves communicating with someone via a fraudulent message in an effort to make them perform and action that will harm them.
It is broken into five main categories:

Spear phishing::
    Sending phishing emails or other communications that are targeted towards a particular business or environment.
    These messages may include information about the inner workings of the organization in an attempt to prove their validity.
    They may also take advantage of a known, insecure practice at a particular organization.
    Spear phishing is not your standard wide-net phishing attempt, but more of a focused, tailored, custom campaign.
Whaling::
    Targeting high-ranking individuals at an organization.
    Whaling is often used in conjunction with spear phishing.
Smishing::
    Using SMS messages when phishing.
Vishing::
    Using voice messages when phishing.
Phishing sites::
    Threat actors can attempt to gain unauthorized access through information obtained from non-business related communication channel.
    For example, malicious actors may know that the CEO frequents a popular sailing forum.
    These actors could set up an account on the sailing forum to direct message the CEO for information.
    
=== SPAM

SPAM consists of large quantities of unsolicited emails.
These emails may be malicious or they may simply be advertising.
In either case SPAM accounts for nearly 85% of all email.
It is interesting to note that sometimes the malware distributed through SPAM is actually used to send more SPAM through a victim's machine.
The war on SPAM is constantly evolving and while many updates have been made to the way we send email, many improvements have yet to be realized.

=== Dumpster Diving

Information that can ultimately lead to the spread of malware can also be found in improperly disposed trash.
Old records or hard drives may contain corporate secrets or credentials that give someone unauthorized access.
It is important to properly dispose of sensitive information, making sure that all things that need to be destroyed are destroyed in a complete manner.

=== Shoulder Surfing

PINs, passwords, and other data can also recovered simply by looking over someone's shoulder.
These credentials could be the "in" that an attacker needs to spread malware.
Through the aid of optics, such a binoculars, shoulder surfing can even occur at a long distance.
Privacy screens, which limit the angle at which you can see a monitor, can be helpful in mitigating this type of attack.

=== Tailgating

Following behind someone who is entering a secure location with a credential is known as tailgating.
Often people will even hold secure doors open for someone if they have their hands full.
It is human nature to want to help people, but you also must remember that the person behind you may have a USB key with malware ready to deploy as soon as they gain physical access to a machine in the building.

=== Impersonation/Identity Theft

Often as part of a phishing campaign, a threat actor will pretend to be someone else.
This may be someone within the organization or someone with sufficient power outside the organization, such as a representative of a government oversight agency.
Attackers may also use stolen credentials to make their messages appear official, once again giving them and easy route through which to deploy malware.

== Lab: Malware Analysis

The website https://any.run[Any Run] offers free interactive malware analysis.
We will be using this site to avoid the complications of running malware in a VM.

Start by visiting https://any.run[Any Run] and registering for an account with your NJIT email address.
Once you have activated your account via email, follow the tutorial to learn how to analyze threats.
Use the demo-sample task provided by Any Run.
Follow the prompts and watch how the process tree changes.
