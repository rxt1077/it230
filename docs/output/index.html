<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Information security</em> (infosec) is largely the practice of preventing <em>unauthorized access</em> to data.
Unauthorized access is when an actor gains access to data that they do not have the permissions to access.
The system is often used in an unintended manner to provide such access.
Data has become an increasingly valuable asset and the <em>risks</em> of others having access to data are incredibly high.
Because of this, information security typically falls under the risk-management plan of a company and its importance cannot be understated.
This is evidenced by the fact that information technology&#8217;s (IT) typical role in a company has migrated from basic a basic service provider to directoships with a seat at the highest decision making table.
This is directly due to the fact that IT assets have become the most valuable things many companies own.
Guarding these assets and managing the inherent risk of their loss is the job of information security professionals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Malicious software</em>, also referred to as malware, is often employed to help an attacker gain access to a system.
Many types of malicious software exist, but the common thread is that they perform actions that cause harm to a computer system or network.
In the case of many attacks, <em>system failure</em> may occur either as an intended (as is the case in Denial of Service (DoS) attacks) or unintended consequence.
This means the system will no longer be able to perform its intended purpose.
System failure is a serious risk that needs to be managed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_learning_the_lingo">1.2. Learning the Lingo</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, the technical fields are laden with acronyms and obtuse vocabulary.
Unfortunately security is no exception to this rule.
Three of the most important acronyms you should be aware of to start are <em>CIA</em>, <em>AAA</em>, and <em>DRY</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_cia">1.2.1. CIA</h4>
<div class="imageblock right">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/cia.svg" alt="cia" width="300" height="128">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the Central Intelligence Agency does have a role to play in information security, for our purposes CIA is an acronym used to remember the three foundational information security principles: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
These ideas form the cornerstone of security and should be ever-present in your thoughts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Confidentiality</em> refers to the practice of keeping secret information secret.
For example, if an e-commerce site stores credit card numbers (a questionable practice to begin with) those credit card numbers should be kept <em>confidential</em>.
You would not want other users of the site or outsiders to have access to your credit card number.
Many steps could be taken to ensure the confidentiality of user credit card numbers, but at this point it is enough to understand that maintaining confidentiality is a principle of security.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Integrity</em> is an assurance that data has not been corrupted or purposefully tampered with.
As we discussed previously, data is very valuable, but how valuable is it if you can&#8217;t be sure it is intact and reliable?
In security we strive to maintain integrity so that the system and even the controls we have in place to guard the system can be trusted.
Imagine that e-commerce site again.
What would happen if an attacker could arbitrarily change delivery addresses stored in the system?
Packages could be routed improper addresses and stolen and honest customers would not receive what they ordered, all because of an integrity violation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Availability</em> means that a system should remain up an running to ensure that valid users have access to the data when needed.
In the simplest sense, you could ensure confidentiality and integrity by simply taking the system off line and not allowing any access.
Such a system would be useless and this final principle addresses that.
Systems are designed to be accessible and part of your security plan should be ensuring that they are.
You will need to account for the costs of implementing confidentiality and integrity and make sure that the resources are available to keep the system working.
In an extreme case, denial of service (DoS) attacks can actually target availability.
By keeping this principle in mind, hopefully you can mitigate some of those risks.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_aaa">1.2.2. AAA</h4>
<div class="imageblock left">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/aaa.svg" alt="aaa" width="200" height="128">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another acronym you&#8217;re going to encounter in many different contexts is AAA.
It stands for <em>Authentication</em>, <em>Authorization</em>, and <em>Accounting</em> and it is used in designing and implementing protocols.
Theses concepts should be remembered when designing security plans.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Authentication is the process of confirming someone&#8217;s identity.
This may be done with user names and passwords or more frequently via multi-factor authentication (MFA) which requires not only something you know, but something you have (fingerprints, key fob, etc.).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Authorization refers to keeping track of which resources an entity has access to.
This can be done via a permission scheme or access control list (ACL).
Occasionally you will encounter something more exotic where authorization limits users to interactions during a particular time of day of from a particular IP address.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Accounting refers to tracking the usage of resources.
This may be as simple as noting in a log file when a user has logged in to keeping track of exactly which services and user uses and how long they use them.
Accounting is incredibly important because it allows you to not only monitor for possible problems, but also inspect what has occurred <em>after</em> a problem is encountered.
Accounting also allows system administrators to show irrefutably what actions as user has taken.
This can be very important evidence in a court of law.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_dry">1.2.3. DRY</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While we&#8217;re dispensing knowledge in the form of three letter acronyms (TLAs), another important acronym to keep in mind is DRY: Don&#8217;t Repeat Yourself.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
Say something once, why say it again?
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Talking Heads<br>
<cite>Psycho Killer</cite>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is of course not entirely literal.
Just because you&#8217;ve explained something to a coworker once does <em>not</em> mean that you shouldn&#8217;t explain it again.
It is meant as more of a guide for how you make use of <em>automation</em> and how you design systems.
Increasingly security experts are not being asked to analyze a single system, but a network of hundreds if not thousands of systems.
In this case you should make use of scripts and tools to make sure you are not manually doing the same thing over and over.
Have you found a good way of testing to see if a part of a system is secure?
Put it in a script so that you can reuse the test on other systems.
This same logic applies to how systems are designed.
Do you have a database of user login info?
Reuse that database across multiple systems.
In short, "Don&#8217;t repeat yourself!"</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_hacker_culture">1.3. Hacker Culture</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The term <em>hacker</em> comes from the sound that programmers would make when typing or <em>hacking</em> away at keyboards.
Originally a hacker was anyone who worked feverishly at a problem on a computer and the term <em>cracker</em> was used to define people who attempted to bypass security systems.
The distinction was eventually lost and a hacker has come to be the popular term for someone attempting to gain unauthorized access to data.
For an interesting glimpse into early hacker culture/reasoning read <a href="https://archive.org/stream/The_Conscience_of_a_Hacker/hackersmanifesto.txt">The Conscience of a Hacker</a> by The Mentor originally published in Phrack Magazine 1986.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">Hacker Hats</div>
<div class="imageblock right">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/hats.png" alt="hats" width="450">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An early attempt at classifying hackers involved assigning hat colors according to their motivations.
This harkens back to the old western movies where the bad guys wore black hats and the good guys wore white hats.
Just as in real life nothing is clearly black and white, as such we&#8217;ve laid the traditional roles on a two-axis continuum from malicious to benevolent and illegal to legal.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">White Hat</dt>
<dd>
<p>These hackers are typically employed by a company to test the security of their systems.
They operate legally with the intent of ultimately improving security.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Black Hat</dt>
<dd>
<p>These hackers operate outside the bounds of the law, and as such are subject to prosecution.
Their intent is nefarious usually involving personal profit, malice, or some combination of the two.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Gray Hat</dt>
<dd>
<p>A gray hat hacker operates illegally but ultimately wants to improve the security of the system.
They may inform administrators of the details of their breach or they may be acting to force a group to better secure their system.
In rare circumstances a gray hat hacker may actually exploit a system for the purposes of hardening it once they have gained administrative access.
It should be noted that despite the good intentions, gray hat hackers are still operating illegally and may be subject to prosecution.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several more hat distinctions (blue hats, green hats, etc.) with mixed meanings.
For example a blue hat may refer to an external entity hired by a company to test the security of a component, as is the case in Microsoft, or it may refer to a hacker motivated by revenge.
It is also worth nothing that the second quadrant of our graph is empty, but this does not mean that there aren&#8217;t malicious, legal hackers.
These may be software developers exploiting legal loopholes or possibly even individuals working for another government engaged in cyber warfare.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="_threat_actors">1.4. Threat Actors</h3>
<div class="imageblock right">

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. Guy Fawkes Mask</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To better be able to manage the risks of a data breach, it helps to be able to identify/understand the attacker or threat actor involved.
Just as there are many reasons an actor may attempt to gain unauthorized access there are also many groups of threat actors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Neophytes making use of automated tools that they may not fully understand are often referred to a <em>script kiddies</em>.
You may hear other pejorative names as well such as lamer, noob, or luser, but the common thread is that these threat actors or <em>not</em> highly sophisticated.
The same techniques used for automating defensive security can also be applied to automating attacks.
Unfortunately this means that you may encounter actors "punching above their weight" or using complex tools while having only a rudimentary understanding of what they do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hacktivist are threat actors that attack to further social or political ends.
These groups can be very sophisticated.
The most well known hacktivist group is <em>Anonymous</em> which has been linked to several politically motivated attacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Organized crime is another element which may employ or support threat actors typically to make money.
These groups typically have access to more resources and contacts than a solo actor.
It is important to note that threat actors with roots in organized crime may find it easier to migrate into other areas of crime due to their proximity to a large criminal enterprise.
For example, while it may be difficult for a script kiddie to broker the sale of valuable data, a hacker working with an organized crime syndicate may have people close to them that are familiar with the sale of stolen goods.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last group of threat actors, and arguably the group with the most resources, are threat actors working with or for governments and nation states.
These groups may have the explicit or implicit permission of their country to commit cyber crimes targeting other nations.
Given the constant threat and resources available to these groups, they are referred to as an advanced persistent threat (APT).
By utilizing the resources of a nation (often including its intelligence and military resources) APTs are a severe threat.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_security_plans">1.5. Security Plans</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While confronting such a diverse array of actors can seem daunting at first, the key element to being successful is having a plan.
A <em>security plan</em> analyzes the risks, details the resources that need to be protected, and presents a clear path to protecting them.
Typically a security plan utilizes the three types of security controls available: physical, administrative, and technical.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Physical controls are things like door locks, cameras, or even the way rooms in a building are laid out.
These things can have a dramatic impact on the overall security and should not be overlooked!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Administrative controls include human resources policies (HR), classifying and limiting access to data, and separating duties.
It helps to have a whole-organization understanding of security to make it easier to put these controls in place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technical controls are often what new security professionals think of first.
These are things like intrusion detection systems (IDS), firewalls, anti-malware software, etc.
While these are an import segment of security and they are the segment that falls almost entirely within the purview of IT, it is critical to remember that these are only as strong as the physical and administrative controls that support them!</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock warning">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-warning" title="Warning"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
Physical controls definitely lack the cool factor that technical controls have.
Movies typically show security professionals hunched over laptops typing frantically or scrolling rapidly through pages and pages of logs on a giant screen.
Rarely do they show them filling out a purchase order (PO) to have a locksmith come in and re-key the locks to the data closet.
Just because it isn&#8217;t cool doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t important!
Remember, once an attacker has physical access, anything is possible.

<h3 id="_tools_of_the_trade">1.6. Tools of the Trade</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With all of this talk regarding how and why hackers attack systems, the question remains, "What can be done?"
There are a few tools the security professional employs that are worth mentioning at this juncture including: <em>user awareness</em>, <em>anti-malware software</em>, <em>backups</em>, and <em>encryption</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">User Awareness</dt>
<dd>
<p>A major risk, some would argue the biggest risk, is that unprepared users will run malware programs or perform other harmful actions as directed by actors looking to gain access.
These actors may impersonate others or perform other <em>social engineering</em> tactics to cause users to do as they say.
Probably the scariest statistic is the ease with which a massive attack requiring little effort can be performed.
Threat actors do not even need to personally reach out to users, they could simply send a mass email.
Through training programs and other methods of interaction a security professional can make users aware of these threats and train them to act accordingly.
Raising user awareness is a critical component of any security plan.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Anti-Malware Software</dt>
<dd>
<p>Given how prevalent the use of malware is a host of tools have been developed to prevent its usage.
These tools may filter downloads requests to prevent downloading malware, monitor network traffic to detect active malware patterns, scan files for malware signatures, or harden operating system loopholes used by malware.
A security plan will typically detail the type of anti-malware software being used as well as the intended purpose of its usage.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Backups</dt>
<dd>
<p>Maintaining a copy of the data used by a system can be a quick solution to the problems of ransomware and other attacks aimed at causing or threatening system failure.
While a backup does not solve the problem of the data being sold or used by others, it does allow for a quick recovery in many instances and should be part of a security plan.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Encryption</dt>
<dd>
<p>At its most simple, encryption obfuscates data and requires a key to make it useful.
Encryption can be employed to make copies of data obtained through unauthorized access useless to attackers that do not have the key.
Often, encryption and backups complement each other and fill in the use cases that each lacks individually.
As such, encryption will show up multiple times and in multiple ways in an average security plan.</p>

<p>For this lab, we will be engaging in a though experiment.
Imagine you are at a university that is having a student appreciation breakfast.
At the entrance to the cafeteria an attendant has a clipboard with all of the student IDs listed.
Students line up, show their ID, and their ID number is crossed off of the list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thinking like a hacker, how would you exploit this system to get extra free breakfasts?
Feel free to think outside the box and make multiple plans depending on the circumstances you would encounter when go the breakfast.
Come up with at least five different ways of getting free breakfasts and then see if you can map them to real-world information security attacks.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter is meant to serve as a brief and gentle introduction to the cryptographic concepts often encountered in the field of security.
It is by no means exhaustive but it should provide a basis for a better understanding of why protocols are designed the way they are.
Cryptography is a method of scrambling data into non-readable text.
It allows us to transform data into a secure form so that unauthorized users cannot view it.</p>

<h3 id="_why_do_we_need_cryptography">2.1. Why do we need cryptography?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cryptography is used to set up secure channels of communication, but it can also be used to provide non-repudiation of actions, basically leaving digital footprints that show someone did something.
This means that cryptography allows us to provide authentication, authorization, <em>and</em> accounting (AAA).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By using a secure and <em>confidential</em> encrypted channel we can be sure that anyone who intercepts our communications cannot "listen in." This helps prevents <em>man-in-the-middle (MITM)</em> attacks.
Cryptography can also be used to provide <em>integrity</em>: proving that the data is valid. With cryptography you can provide a <em>signature</em> for the data showing that the person who claims to have sent it really did send it.
Cryptography also allows for <em>non-repudiation</em> as it can show that only one person was capable of sending a particular message. Lastly cryptography also allows us to perform authentication <em>without</em> storing passwords in plaintext.
This is critical in an age where data breaches are increasingly common.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/refunds/equifax-data-breach-settlement">In September of 2017, Equifax announced a data breach the exposed the personal information of 147 million people.</a>
The original attack made use of an exploit in an outdated version of <a href="https://struts.apache.org/">Apache Struts</a> which was being used as part of Equifax&#8217;s system for handling credit disputes from customers.
Once the attackers had gained access to internal Equifax servers, the began gathering as much information as they could from internal databases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What is particularly egregious about this data breach is that passwords in many databases were stored in plaintext.
This means that the attackers were able to try the passwords and usernames on other services.
While it is important that users use different passwords for different services it is far more disturbing that a company as large as Equifax did not have the policies in place to use cryptography to mitigate the risks from such an enormous breach.</p>

You could use a frequency attack, where you analyze a large chunk of encrypted text knowing that certain letters are more frequent than others.

<h3 id="_keys">2.3. Keys</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Typically a series of random bytes can be used as a key to either encrypt or decrypt data.
A key is used by a cryptographic algorithm to change plaintext to ciphertext.
Keys may also be asymmetric in that they can only be used to perform <em>one</em> of the operations (either encryption or decryption).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is important to have an idea of what factors make a <em>strong</em> cryptographic key.
Length plays an important role.
The longer the key, the hard it is to <em>crack</em> the encryption.
Likewise the randomness of the data in the key also makes it stronger.
If the byte sequence is somehow predictable, the length is irrelevant.
Finally we have the concept of a cryptoperiod or lifetime of a key.
If we are working with a system that frequently changes keys an attacker may not have enough time to crack it.</p>

<h3 id="_mathematical_foundation">2.4. Mathematical Foundation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cryptography relies largely on the concept of one-way or trap door functions.
That is a process that is hard to compute in one direction, but easy to compute in the other.
For example it is much easier for a computer to multiply large numbers than to determine the factors of large numbers.
This is the foundation of the RSA algorithm.
<a href="https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~jpopyack/IntroCS/HW/RSAWorksheet.html">A simplified version of the algorithm</a> is shown below:</p>

<div class="listingblock">

p = a random prime number
q = a random prime number

K = a number which equals one when modded by r and can be factored
e = a factor of K that doesn't share factors with N
d = another factor of K that doesn't share factors with N
Your public key is N and e
Your private key is N and d

ENCRYPTION

cleartext = (11**29)%91 = 72 (decrypted using N and d)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to <em>crack</em> RSA you would need to be able to factor N into it&#8217;s two prime numbers.

You&#8217;ll notice that the algorithm only requires exponentiation, multiplication, and modulus arithmetic.
At no point do you ever have to factor a large prime number to generate keys, encrypt, or decrypt.
You only have to perform that operation if you&#8217;re trying to work backwards without the keys.</p>

<p>Other similar one-way function exist based on elliptical curves.
It turns out that motion along an elliptical curve can be described according to a start and end point and several iterations of a simple algorithm.

If all you know is the start and end point you can&#8217;t determine the initial conditions.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A hashing algorithm is a one-way function that creates hashed text from plaintext.
It is often used for data validation as a relatively small hash <em>digest</em> or <em>signature</em> can demonstrate the integrity of a large block of data.
Hashes can also be used so that sensitive information does not have to be stored in cleartext.
By storing a hash of a password, you can check to see if the correct password was entered without storing the password itself.
In the case of a data breach only the hashes are leaked and the attacker does not have access to the passwords to try with other services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two main families of hash algorithms are used: MD5 and SHA.
MD5 produces a 128-bit hash value and is still often used to verify data integrity.
The algorithm is technically cryptographically broken, but you may still see it in use.
The SHA family of algorithms consists of SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>SHA-1: 160 bits, similar to MD5, designed by the NSA, no longer approved for cryptographic use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SHA-2: SHA-256 and SHA-512, very common with the number indicating the block size, designed by the NSA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SHA-3: non-NSA designed, not widely adopted, similar numbering scheme as SHA-2 (SHA3-256, etc.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dictionary based attacks against password hashes are fairly common.
Typically software is used which generates a hash for every word in the dictionary and then compares that hash to what is stored on the compromised machine.
One way to combat this is through salting or adding random bits to each password.
When salting the bits are stored with the hash.
This forces a dictionary based attack to actively generate the hashes based on what the salt is as opposed to using a stored table (rainbow table) of all the possible hashes.
It can make attacks go from instant to days or even years depending on the complexity of the password.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An even better way of combating attacks against hashes is through a secret salt or <em>pepper</em>.
A pepper is a random value that is added to the password but not stored with the resulting hash.
The random value can be stored in a separate medium such as a hardware Security Module.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Symmetric encryption is probably the simplest encryption to understand in that it only uses a single key (in this case our key is labelled 'A') to encrypt or decrypt data.
Both parties need to know the private key in order to communicate.
It does pose a security risk in that if the channel used for key exchange is insecure, all of the messages can be decrypted.
That being said, given that it is simpler than many other forms of encryption, it is often used for secure communication or storage.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>One-time-pad (OTP) is a rare example of a pen and paper, symmetric encryption scheme that cannot be cracked.
The difficulty in OTP mirrors the difficulty with all symmetric encryption, namely that pre-shared keys need to be exchanged at some point.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine that a prisoner wishes to send encrypted messages to someone outside the prison.
To do so, they will make use of a copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone that they have in their cell.
The message they want to send is "DIG UP THE GOLD".
They turn to "Chapter One: The Boy Who Lived" and look up the first twelve letters in the chapter: MR AND MRS DURS.
For each letter of their message, they convert it to its number in the alphabet: 4 9 7 21 16 20 8 5 7 15 12 4 (DIG UP THE GOLD).
They do the same for the key they looked up in their book: 13 18 1 14 4 13 18 19 4 21 18 19 (MR AND MRS DURS).
Finally they add the two numbers to get their ciphertext: 17 27 8 35 20 33 26 24 11 36 30 23.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the prisoner sends that ciphertext to someone on the outside who knows that they key is the first chapter of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone, they will be able to subtract the key from each of the numbers in the ciphertext and discover the plaintext message.
While theoretically unbreakable, anybody else who has the key can recover the text as well.
This means that using common keys like popular books make it trivial for a man-in-the-middle to decode the ciphertext.
After all, the warden probably knows every book that the prisoner has in their cell.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An asymmetric encryption algorithm has actually already been demonstrated in the <a href="#_mathematical_foundation">Mathematical Foundation</a> section.
Asymmetric encryption has a public key which can be published anywhere and used to encrypt messages that only the holder of the private key, which is not published, can unencrypt.
For example if you want to receive encrypted emails you may make your <a href="https://gnupg.org/">GNU Privacy Guard (GPG)</a> public key available a <a href="https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/">public key server</a>.
This would allow anyone to look up your public key, encrypt a message that only you can read, and send you the ciphertext.
Asymmetric encryption gets around the difficulties of key exchange via an untrusted channel (like email).
Unfortunately the cost of such a useful system is that asymmetric algorithms tend to be much slower that their symmetric counterparts.</p>

<h3 id="_stream_ciphers">2.8. Stream Ciphers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Stream ciphers encode data one symbol at a time and produces one ciphertext symbol for each cleartext symbol.
Given that you can often use some sort of block encryption with a significantly small block size, stream encryption is not used as often.
Technically the OTP example, when used one symbol at a time, is a stream cipher.
The keys come in one symbol at a time, the cleartext comes in one symbol at a time, and an operation is performed (addition in the case of the example) to create the ciphertext.
Given a suitable keysize and a well-researched algorithm, stream ciphers can be just as secure as block ciphers.
That being said a stream cipher is usually more consistent in its runtime characteristics and typically consumes less memory
Unfortunately there are not as many well-researched algorithms and widely used stream ciphers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_block_ciphers">2.9. Block Ciphers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Block ciphers takes the data in, in blocks and use cipher blocks of the same size to perform the encryption.
It is very popular and there are many secure algorithms to choose from.
Unfortunately if the input data doesn&#8217;t fit neatly into blocks of the same size, padding may be required, which takes up more space/memory and reduces the speed of the cipher.
As such the block encryption is often less performant than stream encryption.</p>

<h4 id="_block_cipher_modes_of_operation">2.9.1. Block Cipher Modes of Operation</h4>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The simplest mode of operation, data is divided into blocks and each block is encoded using a key.
Since the blocks are encoded the same way, identical blocks will give identical ciphertexts.
This makes it easier, given enough data, to determine what the key is.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Starting with an initialization vector (IV) each block is XORed with part of the ciphertext of the previous block to create a chain of ciphertext that is constantly changing.
This means that identical blocks will result in <em>different</em> ciphertexts.
This is the most common mode of operation, its weaknesses being that the algorithm cannot be run in parallel (sorry modern processors) and that the IV is a common attack target.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead of using an IV, CTR uses a nonce (random number that is the same for all blocks) and counter.
The counter is incremented with each block, meaning this mode can function in parallel.
CTR mode solves the problems of ECB while still providing an algorithm that can run quickly on modern machines.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>GCM uses a counter like CTR, but does not make use of a nonce.
Instead an IV is used with the inititial counter.
GCM also generates a message authentication code (MAC) for each block to verify the integrity of the block.
This combination makes for a modern, robust algorithm that is gaining rapid adoption.</p>

<div class="title">Case Study: Exploiting Non-Rolling Codes</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The importance of non-repeating codes, such as the counter codes used in the CTR and GCM block cipher modes of operation can be highlighted through analysis of another important technology that uses codes: keyless entry systems.
When garage door openers first came on to the market, the remote would broadcast a single code that the receiver was programmed to recognize as correct.
This meant that anyone listening in could easily get the code and replay the code to open the garage door with their own device.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> To combat this, companies began using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_code">rolling codes</a> in their remotes and receivers. Given the same seed a rolling code allows each device to generate a sequence of codes that are exactly the same. The remote will use the next code in a sequence every time the button is hit. The receiver will validate the recieved code if it matches any of the next several codes in the sequence (in case the button was hit a few times out of range). This effectively mitigates the replay attack.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given that this was implemented in the 1980s with garage door remotes, you would assume car manufacturers employ the same technology in their remotes.
In a case of "everything old is new again" this isn&#8217;t true.
<a href="https://github.com/HackingIntoYourHeart/Unoriginal-Rice-Patty/blob/main/README.md">Blake Berry (HackingIntoYourHeart) discovered that several makes and models of cars are actually still vulnerable to a replay attack.</a></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sammy Kamkar also discovered a vulnerablility for rolling codes, named RollJam, which he demonstrated at DEF CON 23.
Kamkar&#8217;s device jams signals sent by a keyfob, while recording the codes being sent.
Once it has two codes recorded, presumably from the victim pressing the button multiple times, it stops jamming, sends out the first code to unlock the car and stores the second code to unlock the car at a later time.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>AES is a symmetric block cipher developed in 1998 to supersede the less secure Data Encryption Standard (DES).
AES works on 128 bit blocks of data, performing multiple rounds of substitution-permutation to encrypt data.
You will find AES used to encrypt network traffic (as is the case in a virtual private network), data stored to disk (disk encryption), or computer game data that is saved to storage.
AES is a <em>very</em> common cipher.</p>

<p>ECC is an asymmetric encryption scheme that is quite fast and easy to computer.
It is rapidly becoming the go to choice for digital signatures and key exchanges, gaining adopting starting in 2004.
ECC is based on the geometry of a pre-determined set of curves (some examples can be found <a href="http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf">here</a>), which can be used to create a trapdoor function.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given the slow nature of asymmetric algorithms, often an application such as a VPN will choose to use asymmetric cryptography to exchange a shared secret key and then use that secret key with a faster symmetric algorithm such as AES.
Diffie-Hellman does exactly that and was first published in 1976.
Diffie-Hellman key exchange uses the same mathematical concepts as RSA, exponentiation and modulus arithmetic, to great effect, but to visualize what is happening a metaphor of secret color mixing is used (see the included diagram).
It is important to remember that because the medium of exchange may be slow a DH key exchange is designed to generate minimal traffic.</p>

<h4 id="_digital_certificates">2.10.5. Digital Certificates</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A digital certificate is a set of credentials used to identify a company or an individual.
Since asymmetric encryption requires know a party&#8217;s public key, a digital certificate includes that key as well as an ID of the owner.
The question then becomes how do you trust that the public key is <em>actually</em> for the alleged owner?
That&#8217;s where the issuing authority comes in.
A <em>certificate authority (CA)</em> signs the certificate indicating that the ID and public_key are correct.
Certificates can be self-signed, but this sidesteps the trust placed in the CA and is often only used in testing.
Since most certificates are used for encrypting web traffic, Web browsers will typically warn you if a site is using a self-signed certificate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given how how many certificates need to be issued and the work that needs to be done to verify them, most certs are not issues by root CAs, but are actually issued by intermediate CAs.
Root CAs delegate the work to Intermediate CAs and indicate their trust in them by signing the intermediate CAs keys.
This creates a <em>chain of trust</em> from the issued certificate (signed by the Intermediate CA) to the Intermediate CA (signed by the root CA) to the root CA (trusted by the browser).
Tools that use this chain of trust will keep the root CA certificates and update them from the companies that issue them as needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The certificate store is very important and while users rarely interact with it is often possible to install root CAs manually.
<a href="https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/configure-fiddler/tasks/trustfiddlerrootcert">This is can be used to create a proxy that can decrypt HTTPS traffic for debugging</a> or for more nefarious purposes.
For this reason some applications, Facebook mobiles apps for example, maintain their own certificate store and prevent users from adding root CAs to it.</p>

<p>So how do you get a certificate for your website?
The customer will generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) that includes the public key and their ID.
The CA will validate that the customer owns the website and build and sign the cert.

<p>It is hard to talk about cryptography without addressing blockchains, one of the concepts behind cryptocurrencies.
A blockchain is a shared ledger (of transactions in the case of BitCoin) where blocks are constantly being added to add to the information being stored.
Periodically an new block is created, which includes a hash of the previous block and a hash of itself for the next block to reference.
By examining these hashes, you can prove the integrity each block and its position, thus making a publicly-available, mutually agreed upon accounting of what has occurred on the network.
Typically to prevent bad actors from adding block some sort of proof of work, a mathematically difficult operation, or proof of stake, an accounting of investment in the network, must be included when adding a block to the chain.</p>

HSMs are removable modules while TPMs are motherboard chips.
Many ciphers rely on a reliable source of entropy (randomness) which these modules provide.
They can also significantly increase the speed at which cryptographic algorithms run by moving the operations to specialized hardware.
Lastly, these modules can be used to store keys <em>and</em> make them only accessible via the module.
This can add an extra layer of security to prevent the keys from being easily copied.</p>

The hidden data can also be encrypted if an additional layer of security is required.
In the field of security, malicious code may be hidden inside other files using steganographic techniques.

<div class="title">Hash it Out</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <em>hash</em> is a one-way cryptographic function that produces a <em>unique</em> set of characters for a given <em>message</em>.
In a perfect world, given a hash you should <em>not</em> be able to determine what the original message was, but given a hash and the original message you can check that the hash matches the message.
Before we dive into the uses of a hash, lets try to further understand it by looking at a simple and consequently poor hashing algorithm.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Anagram Hash</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s assume we wanted to hash the message "Hello from Karl" so that we can have a string of characters the uniquely represent that phrase.
One way to do it would be to strip all the punctuation in the message, make everything lowercase, and then arrange all the letters alphabetically.
"Hello from Karl" becomes "aefhklllmoorr".
You can think of it like saying, "There is one 'a' in the message, one 'e' in the message, one 'f' in the message', one 'k' in the message, three 'l&#8217;s in the message&#8230;&#8203;"
Now our hash, "aefhklllmoorr", can be used to uniquely identify the phrase.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now assume Karl wants to send us a message but he can&#8217;t trust the person sending the message.
He could use the untrusted party to send us the message and then put the hash someplace public like on a website.
We could use the hash to know the message came from Karl <em>and</em> if anyone else got the hash they would not be able to discern the message because a hash is a one-way function.
"aefhklllmoorr" reveals very little about the message, but it can be used to check its accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hopefully this is beginning to show the power of hashes.
Now lets examine another very common usecase and find out exactly why this is a terrible algorithm.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assume you run a website where a user uses a password to log in.
You want to make sure users are using their password when they log in, but you do not want to store the password on your website.
This is quite common.
If you website was breached you don&#8217;t want to leak a bunch of people&#8217;s passwords.
What do you do?
What you could do is store a hash of their password, hash the password when they try to login, and compare the hashes.
For example if our password was "password" using our basic hash algorithm the hash would be "adoprssw".
We could store "adoprssw" in our database, use it for comparison during login, and if someone were to ever steal the data in our database they wouldn&#8217;t know that the original password is "password".
This may prevent an attacker from exploiting the fact that many people use the same password on multiple sites.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem is that there are many things that hash to "adoprssw" including "wordpass", "drowsaps", or even the hash we&#8217;re storing: "adoprssw".
When multiple messages have the same hash it is referred to as a <em>collision</em> and this particular algorithm is useless because it generates so many of them.</p>

<p>MD5 is a message-digest algorithm that produces significantly better hashes than our Anagram algorithm.
Most Linux distributions include a simple utility for creating an MD5 hash based on a file&#8217;s contents.
This command is named md5sum.
Typically this is used to detect if a file has been tampered with.
A website may provide links to download software as well as an MD5 hash of the files so that you know what you&#8217;ve downloaded is correct.
Similarly a security system may keep md5sums (MD5 hashes) of certain critical files to determine if they have been tampered with by malware.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given that <code>test</code> is in the included common password wordlist, <code>/usr/share/john/password.lst</code>, you will quickly find that John the Ripper figures out that karl&#8217;s password is <code>test</code>.
John the Ripper can also run incrementally though all the possible character combinations, but it takes much longer.
To help make these types of attacks more difficult, every hash in <code>/etc/shadow</code> is built off of a random number.
This number is called a <em>salt</em> and is stored with the hash.
This means that instead of just trying one hash for each word in the wordlist, the hash cracker must try every possible salt for every word in the wordlist, slowing things down significantly.
Modern hash crackers may use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table">rainbow tables</a> so that all of the possible hashes have already been computed.
These tables may take up terabytes of disk space, but can make cracking even complicated hashes much simpler.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s use <a href="https://www.mkssoftware.com/docs/man1/openssl_passwd.1.asp">the openssl passwd command</a> to show that <code>test</code> is the actual password.
Note that the salt is stored in between the second set of <code>$</code> in the karl users line in <code>/etc/shadow</code>.
The number in between the first set of <code>$</code> is the version of the hashing algorithm being used, six in our case.
Your salt <em>will be different</em> so when you execute these commands you will need to copy and paste it accordingly.</p>

<p>The website <a href="https://any.run">Any Run</a> offers free interactive malware analysis.
We will be using this site to avoid the complications of running malware in a VM.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Start by visiting <a href="https://any.run">Any Run</a> and registering for an account with your NJIT email address.
Once you have activated your account via email, follow the tutorial to learn how to analyze threats.
Use the demo-sample task provided by Any Run.
Follow the prompts and watch how the process tree changes.
Feel free to take your time, even after the time expires you will still be able to look at the running processes and analyze HTTP Requests, Connections, DNS Requests, and Threats.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this lab we are going to look at an example of <a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/backdoor-avemaria/">Backdoor.AveMaria</a>, a family of Remote Access Trojans (RATs) which taget Windows systems.
On the left-hand side of the Any Run site, click on <em>Public Submissions</em> and search for the <code>avemaria</code> tag.
Choose <em>one</em> of the examples (there are hundreds) and look through the screenshots to get an idea of how the malware is run.
It may also help to glance at the network traffic processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Run the VM live by clicking <em>Restart</em> in the upper right-hand corner.
Perform the actions necessary to trigger the malware, adding time as needed.
Finally open notepad on the VM, type in your name, and take a unique screenshot.</p>
