= Protocols

Protocols can be though of as rules that dictate communication.
A protocol may include information about the syntax used, error correction, synchronization, or any other aspect of how communication occurs in the context of that situation. 
In computer security it is important to have a thorough understanding of common protocols as their weaknesses often determine how and if an attack will occur.
Protocols exist for both hardware and software and have been developed via individuals and organizations.
Early networking protocols were often developed on mailing lists using Requests for Comments (RFCs).
You may still see RFCs being crafted, referred to, or actively worked on.
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616[Some of the earliest web protocols are detailed in RFCs.]
More often than not, large protocols have working groups and associations developing, such as the 802.11 group at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers which handles WiFi protocols.
These groups publish papers detailing how the protocols work.

== Link Layer Protocols

=== ARP

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used on the local ethernet segment to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses.
Since this protocol functions at the ethernet segment level, security was not a primary concern.
Unfortunately this means that ARP communications can be easily spoofed to cause a MitM scenario.
A malicious actor simply sends out several ARP packets, _gratuitous arp_ saying that traffic for a certain IP address should be sent to them.
Since the MAC to IP address table is cached in several places, it can take a long time to resolve an issue caused by malicious ARP frames.

There is a protocol designed to mitigate the issues with ARP.
Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) reaches across layers to work with the DHCP lease database and drop packets that are not using the MAC address used when a DHCP lease was granted.
While this can solve many of the issues associated with ARP it is also a good practice to use secure higher-level protocols such as HTTPS just in case.

== Internet Layer Protocols

=== IP

IP stands for internet protocol and it was devised to allow creating a network of networks.
The network of networks that uses it primarily is the Internet, although you could use IP in other scenarios as well.
IP is primarily concerned with _routing_ traffic across and to networks.
The protocol was first detailed by the IEEE in 1974 and comes from the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) project, which created the first large packet switched network.

Most people are familiar with IP in terms of IP addresses, the unique number given to a host participating in an IP network.
Currently there are two main versions of the IP protocol, IPv4 and IPv6, and one of the major differences is in how many IP addresses are available.
IPv4 supports 32 bit addresses and IPv6 supports 128 bit addresses.
To give an idea of how big of a change that is, we have currently allocated all possible IPv4 addresses, but with IPv6 we could give an address to every grain of sand on the beaches of earth and still not run out.

.IPv6 Security Implications
****
From a security standpoint, the way addresses are used in IPv4 vs IPv6 has big consequences.
Since there aren't enough IPv4 addresses a typical internet user is assigned a local address that gets translated to an external IPv4 address when they route their packets through their router.
This is refered to as Network Address Translation (NAT) and is usually handled by an all-in-one device that also makes sure external entities cannot connect to the internal network.

With IPv6 addresses each host on that same _internal_ network can be given an external IPv6 address.
A _basic_ IPv6 router may simply pass the packets to the network without blocking connections to the internal network.
If the machines are not hardened or a firewall is not put in place/enabled the machines could be subject to attack.

As a computer security specialist it is important to test not only IPv4 connectivity, but also IPv6 to ensure that your network is configured approriately.
****

=== ICMP

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is largely used to send messages between systems when IP doesn't work.
For example, lets say we tried to connect to a host but our router doesn't know how to get there.
Our router can send us an ICMP _Destination Unreachable_ message to let us know that something is going wrong.
Because ICMP messages work at the network layer, we will receive this message even if there is an issue with the internet layer.

The most common use for ICMP is the `ping` command.
`ping` sends an ICMP echo request to check to see if a host is up.
By responding to the request with the data included in the request we can assume that the host is up and functioning.

ICMP is also used in the `traceroute` command.
`traceroute` incrementally increase the Time To Live (TTL) field of ICMP packets and watches for _TTL Exceeded_ messages to determine what route packets are taking to get to a host.
Example `traceroute` output is shown below:

[source, console]

----
<1> Notice these routers not responding to ICMP packets

Despite the usefulness of ICMP, ICMP packets from external sources are often ignored.
Network engineers use ICMP to troubleshoot their own networks, but it would be a security issue to allow outside parties to do the same.
As such, do not expect all external hosts to respond to pings.
They may still be up, but you'll need to figure out https://nmap.org/book/man-host-discovery.html[another way to detect them.]

Network address translation (NAT) is primarily used to allow local IP address to share a public IPv4 address.
Given the lack of IPv4 address space many devices have to share a single address.
As mentioned when discussing IPv6, NAT routers often also include security features such as a stateful firewall as the complexity of the hardware required to perform NAT is equivalent to what would be needed for a firewall.

=== IPsec

Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is used to set up a point-to-point encryption tunnel to secure data in transit across IP networks.
IPsec is used primarily in dedicated VPN links and makes use of three main parts: SA, ESP, and AH:

* SA stands for security association and is a channel used to set up encryption parameters and exchange keys.
  This happens via UDP on port 500.
* ESP stands for encapsulating security protocol and is used to encrypt IP headers and payloads.
  It is sent using standard IP packets with the protocol field set to 50.
* AH stands for authentication header and they can optionally be used in standard IP packets with the protocol field set to 51.
  AH simply ensures that a packet hasn't been tampered with.

== Transport Layer Protocols

=== TCP

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is at the heart of most networks.
It provides for reliable communication via a three way hand shake, breaks large data segments into packets, ensures data integrity, and provides flow control for those packets.
This all comes at a cost of course, and this connection-oriented protocol typically has higher latency than its counterparts.
Given the complex nature of TCP is has often been targeted for attacks.
TCP stacks are constantly adapting and changing (within the paramters of the protocol) to avoid DoS and MitM attacks.footnote:[For an interesting example of how you can change but still follow a protocol, check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_cookies[SYN cookies].]

=== UDP

User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol designed for instances where TCP may have too much latency.
UDP achieves this performance boost by not having handshaking or flow control.
The result is a speedy protocol that sometimes drops datagrams.
UDP is often used as the basis for gaming or streaming protocols where the timing of the packets is more important that whether or not they all arrive.
UDP does still employ checksums so you can be sure of the integrity of any UDP packets that you do receive.

=== Common Ports and Services

Port numbers are used in a transport layer connection to specify which service to connect to.
This allows a single host to have multiple services running on it.
Ports 0 to 1023 are _well-known ports_ and typically support a commonly used service.
In most operating systems it takes administrative priveleges to bind to a Well-known port and listen for connections.
Registered ports range from 1024 to 49151 and do not require administrative priveleges to run a service on.
You may find many things listening on these ports as any user can have a service on them.
Lastly ports 49152 to 65535 are used dynamically by applications as needed.

It is important to know some commonly used ports as the services running on these ports may be subject to an attack.
When scanning a machine, only necessary ports should be open.

== Application Layer Protocols

=== DHCP

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is used to allow new clients on a network to obtain an IP address and information about services provided.
IPv4 addresses can be thought of as being in two groups: static addresses and dynamic addresses.
Dynamic addresses are distributed by a DHCP server for a particular lease time.
When the time is up, the DHCP server may distribute the address to another client.
DHCP servers can also give information about proxies, Domain Name Servers (DNS), gateways and even where to get a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment[where to get a kernel to boot an OS over the network!]

Given the dynamic nature of modern networks, with clients coming and going, DHCP is the standard.
From a security standpoint someone impersonating a DHCP server can wreak havoc on a network.
These rogue DHCP servers can cause traffic to be redirected to initiate MitM attacks or cause DoS attacks.
DHCP relies on broadcast Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages and does not make use of authentication, meaning that once an attacker is on the same ethernet segment as the victim machines all bets are off.

=== HTTP

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a text based protocol that governs how web traffic moves.
It is built on the concept of a _request_ and a _response_.
A typical request has an _method_ and a _path_, such as `GET /index.html` which would retrieve the landing page of a website.
Responses have a code, message, and optionally data.
Some standard responses are shown below:

|===
|Code|Message

|200|OK
|202|Accepted
|400|Bad Request
|401|Unauthorized
|403|Forbidden
|404|Not Found
|500|Internal Server Error
|502|Bad Gateway
|503|Service Unavailable
|===

Both requests and responses can take advantage of _headers_, arbitrary lines of text following the initial request or response.
Since headers were designed to be open-ended, many new headers have been added over time.
A modern web request/response usually has far more information in the headers than just the basics defined in HTTP 1.1.
Unencrypted HTTP traffic is sent over port 80 and is vulnerable to attack as all information is sent in cleartext.

=== SSL/TLS

....

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or the more modern nomenclature Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol that allows cleartext protocols used on the web to be encrypted.
It is a general purpose protocol, designed as a layer through which other protocols communicate.
Some protocols typically wrapped in TLS include HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, VoIP, and many VPN protocols.
TLS uses a handshake to exchange certificate information as shown in the diagram.
It should be noted that at the time of writing TLS 1.3 is the most current version, but only half of websites support it.
TLS 1.2, the most common version, is still considered safe if best practices are followed and TLS 1.1 or lower is considered depreciated.

=== HTTPS

image::https.png[float=right, width=400, link=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HTTPS_icon.png]

Hypertext Transer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) solves the problem of unecrypted traffic by wrapping HTTP requests in TLS.
HTTPS traffic uses port 443 and is typically signified in a browser with a lock icon in the upper left-hand corner.
By clicking on the icon users can learn more about the certificates being used for communication.
Utilizing a robust PKI HTTPS allows for safe HTTP communication between client and server.

=== RDP

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is build into Windows and is typically used to control a machine remotely.
It works over port 3389 via TCP or UDP.
While RDP can be quite useful for performing remote administration on a remote machine, it can also be a large security hole if a bad actor gains access.
RDP use in ransomware attacks is on the rise as ransomware programs may use RDP to find other machines to attack.

=== Telnet

Telnet is an antiquated remote administration tool that gives access to a shell via a cleartext channel.
Telnet runs on port 23 and while still occasionally in use it should largely be phased out.
You will still find telnet in embedded applications and legacy systems.
You may also see the client being used to inspect other types of traffic.
For example, you can use a telnet client to submit HTTP requests or send email via SMTP.

=== SSH

Secure Shell (SSH) is the most widely deployed remote administration tool.
SSH provides access to a shell via an encrypted connection.
SSH supports many options including SOCKS5 proxies, port forwarding, and the usage of multiple authentication schemes: password, key, hardware device, etc.
SSH uses TCP on port 22.

=== LDAP

Lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) is used for accessing and maintaining directory information services.
It's primary use is with Windows Active Directory (AD) where it can be used to obtain information regarding users and resources from an AD server.
Clients can authenticate through the server and obtain privileges to read or read/write certain entries.
LDAP did not originally support encryption, so LDAP over SSL (LDAPS) was developed.
LDAP uses TCP and UPD over prot 389 and LDAPS uses TCP over port 636.

=== DNS

Domain Name System (DNS) is used to resolve domain names to IP addresses.
Domain names are the simple names people are accustomed to for websites, such as `njit.edu` as opposed to `54.83.189.142`.
Names are significantly easier for people to remember than IP addresses.
Inorder for a computer to resolve a name, it first queries a local cache, then its primary DNS server.
Assuming the DNS server cannot find the name it will query a Root server for a Top Level Domain (TLD) server, which maintains a listing of Authoritative Nameservers for that particular domain (edu, com, net, org, gov, etc.).
Finally once an authoritative nameserver is found it will respond with the IP address for that particular hostname which will be cached and sent back through the user's primary DNS server to the user.

DNS is designed to be resilient and decentralized but unfortunately the traffic is not authenticated or encrypted.
This has made it a target for MitM attacks.
Likewise cache hits and misses https://kb.isc.org/docs/aa-00509[can yield information as to what names have been recently resolved] (as was the case in discovering the extent of the Sony Rootkit).
The recursive nature has of DNS has also allowed for DoS attacks in the past, but much of that has been solved by limiting recursive queries to the user-facing DNS servers (ie. the one given to you by your DHCP request).
DNS operates via UDP (and occasionally TCP) on port 53.

=== DNSSEC

Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is a suite of extension specifications designed to authenticate responses to domain name lookups.
This can help prevent MitM attacks by checking the digital signature of the responding server.
While this is certainly helpful, it is important to note that DNSSEC does not provide confidentiality.
DNS resolutions can still be monitored by anyone who has access to the traffic.

Starting nmap_scanner_1  ... done
Recreating nmap_victim_1 ... done
----

Now we actually have to containers running, one named `victim` which is our target machine and another named `scanner` which we will use to learn about nmap.
Lets start a BASH shell on `scanner` and work from there:

[source, console]
----
PS C:\Users\rxt1077\temp\nmap> docker-compose run scanner bash
Creating nmap_scanner_run ... done
root@7b6d733cc03a:/# <1>
----
<1> Notice the prompt change. We are now _inside_ the `scanner` container running BASH.

Lets use the Linux `ip addr` command to see what our IP address on this network is:

[source, console]
----

----

We care about the `eth0` device, so as you can see on my machine the address is `172.20.0.2`.
We will use nmap's ping scan to search for any device within the last 8 bits of our IP address (`/24`).
You may notice that we are actually on a `/16` subnet, but by limiting ourselves to `/24` the scan will go _much_ faster.

One of which is conveniently named victim.

====
https://nmap.org/book/man-host-discovery.html[Read the nmap documentation for host discovery.]
What other types of scans could you use if a host does not respond to an ICMP ping packet?
====

Now lets do a full scan on on the victim machine.
Docker Compose does a nice job of resolving DNS requests for sensible names in the `docker-compose.yml` file so we can refer to the host we want to scan as `victim`.

By default, nmap uses a https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/SYN-scanning[SYN] scan against well known ports.
This type of scan is harder to detect (as it does not fully open a connection) and can be run quickly.

[IMPORTANT.deliverable]
====
What ports are open on the victim machine? Why is _this_ particular protocol insecure?
====

nmap is capable of much more than just simple port scanning.
nmap includes version detection and OS fingerprinting (among other things).
To get a much better picture of what exactly `victim` is running, you can use the `-A` option:

[source, console]

What additional information did you learn from the `-A` option?
How do you think this could be exploited?
====

Now, using the `scanner` container you are currently on see what you can find out about `victim`.
https://linux.die.net/man/1/ftp[This man page may be of some help.]

[IMPORTANT.deliverable]
====
BONUS: Remembering what you learned in the _Hash it Out_ lab, what is the root password on the victim machine?
====

[IMPORTANT.deliverable]
====
BONUS: How can you test to see if you got it right? What does this say about how ProFTP is configured on `victim`?
====

When you are all done poking around, you can exit the shell and run `docker-compose down` to stop `victim` from running in the background.
